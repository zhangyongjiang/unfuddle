<h3>About XO</h3>

<p>
XO is my first Android project. Hope you like it.
</p>

<p>
I have been thinking to develop a mobile + local + social + video application for some time. 
Eventually I picked up dating.
</p>

<h4>Why XO?</h4>
<p>
It's because XO represents kiss and hug which is meaningful for a dating application.

These days it's quite common for messages on social-oriented bulletin
boards to end with signoffs like 'Hi and hugs to everybody.' In fact,
this has become so popular that as much as 7.5% of the disk space on
some BBS's is currently devoted to this particular comment. The
International Committee for Relatively Pointless Abbreviations and
Badly Misspelled Acronyms (SPUDS) has just released a new,
internationally approved list of abbreviated signoffs. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> xxx = kisses 
<li> ooo = hugs 
<li> XXX = big kisses 
<li> OOO = big hugs 
<li> oo = hugs for everybody but you 
<li> OO! = big, excited hugs 
<li> CCC = hugs for people you can't quite reach around 
<li> OOQ = hugging with tongue 
<li> xx@ = kisses and earlobe nibbling 
<li> zzz = snoring 
<li> yyy = anything that occurs between kissing and snoring" 
</ul>
