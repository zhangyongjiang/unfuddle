  <li>Onsalelocal business partners or advertisers, as part of an offer, contest, or other activity that is provided by or in conjunction with Onsalelocal and its business partners and in which you have elected to participate. For example, if you are referred to Onsalelocal from a business partner's website or through an invitation facilitated by or in conjunction with a Onsalelocal business partner, Onsalelocal may provide that business partner with Contact Information and Transactional Information to validate the referral and to support the terms of the relationship between Onsalelocal and the business partner, which may allow such business partner to contact you directly and to advertise to you; </li>

We may also disclose Personal Information to defend ourselves in litigation or a regulatory action, and when required or advised to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, or similar legal process, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate. If Onsalelocal is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on one or more of our Sites of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information; </li>
  <li>With your consent.</li>
  <p>We encourage Onsalelocal merchants and business partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personal Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control. </p>
  <p>We may also disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable. For example, we may provide our merchants, business partners, or other third parties with reports that contain aggregated and statistical data about our users. </p>
  <h4>5. COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
  <p>When you use our Sites, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use our Sites and applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information. </p>
  <p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to our Sites by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers. </p>
  <p>For example, when you visit our Sites, Onsalelocal and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Sites. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your Site activity with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Sites. </p>
  <p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. "Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences. </p>
  <p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions. </p>
  <p>We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Sites, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Sites. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Site and the website you visit after you leave our Site, if this information is supplied to us by your browser. </p>
  <p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about Site users to optimize our Sites and understand its traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. In that case, this Privacy Statement governs how we use that information. </p>
  <p>Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive Location Information, we will collect that automatically. If we associate Location Information with other Personal Information, this Privacy Statement governs how we would use that information too. </p>
  <p>Onsalelocal has relationships with third party advertising companies to place advertisements on our behalf onto other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for our Sites and our advertisements. We do not share Personal Information with third party advertising companies; however, these third parties may automatically collect information about your visit to our Sites and other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use to visit this Site. They do this by using cookies, clear gifs and other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other websites tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Statement does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by these third parties, and Onsalelocal is not responsible for cookies or clear gifs in third party ads. We encourage you to review the privacy policies or statements of these third party advertising companies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technologies. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by third party advertisers, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org.
  </p><p>We use Google Analytics to help us understand how visitors interact with our website and to help improve our user experience.</p>
  <h4>6. YOUR CHOICES</h4>
  <p>We think that you benefit from a more personalized experience when we know more about you and the kinds of coupons you like. However, you can limit the information you provide to Onsalelocal, and you can limit the communications that Onsalelocal sends to you. </p>

If you wish to opt out of receiving offers directly from Onsalelocal merchants or business partners, you can follow the opt-out instructions in the emails that they send you. </p>
  <h4>Cookies</h4>
  <p>You may manage how your browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting its privacy and security settings. Browsers are different, so refer to instructions related to your browser to learn about cookie-related and other privacy and security settings that may be available. You can opt-out of being targeted by certain third party advertising companies online at www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp. </p>

  <p>If you access any of our Sites through a mobile device or mobile browser, you may manage how your Location Information is shared with Onsalelocal. For example, our mobile device applications provide you the ability to opt-out of sharing your Location Information. You may also manage how your mobile device or mobile browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting your mobile device privacy and security settings. Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your mobile device and mobile browser settings. </p>
  <h4>Connecting through Social Networks</h4>
  <p>You may manage the sharing of certain Personal Information when you register with us through a social media platform or application, such as through Facebook Connect. Please refer to the privacy settings of the social media platform or application to determine how you may adjust our permissions and manage the interactivity between Onsalelocal and your social media account. By registering with Onsalelocal through a social media platform, you grant Onsalelocal permission to access all of the elements of your social network profile information that you have made available to be shared and to use it in accordance with the social network's terms of use and this Privacy Statement. </p>
  <h4>Onsalelocal SMS Programs</h4>
  <p>To utilize certain features of the Sites, you may be required to enter your mobile phone number. We will only use your mobile phone number to send you specific deals that you have requested to be sent to your mobile device and to send you alerts, from time to time, related to special offers. You can opt out of Onsalelocal SMS programs at any time by emailing optout@onsalelocal.com . </p>
  <h4>7. ACCESSING AND CORRECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
  <p>Keeping Personal Information about you current helps ensure that we offer you the best coupons available through our merchants and business partners. You can do several things to help keep Personal Information about you current. You can access, update and delete your Contact Information and the other information you provided us to use in your profile by logging into the Community and clicking on the "Profile" link. </p>
  <p>If you want to close your account or have other questions or requests, please Contact Us. </p>
  <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at remove@Onsalelocal.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>
  <h4>8. SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
  <p>Onsalelocal has implemented an information security program that contains administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard Personal Information. </p>
  <h4>
  9. NOTICE TO RESIDENTS OF COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</h4>

Personal Information may be accessed by us or transferred to us in the United States or to our affiliates, business partners, merchants, or service providers elsewhere in the world. By providing us with Personal Information, you consent to this transfer. We will protect the privacy and security of Personal Information according to our Privacy Statement, regardless of where it is processed or stored. </p>
  <h4>10. PRIVACY PRACTICES OF THIRD PARTIES</h4>
  <p>This Privacy Statement only addresses the use and disclosure of information by Onsalelocal through your interaction with the Sites. Other websites that may be accessible through links from our Sites may have their own privacy statements and personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices. Our merchants and business partners may have their own privacy statements, too. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statements provided by these other parties prior to providing them with information or taking advantage of an offer or promotion. </p>
  <h4>11. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</h4>
  <p>From time to time, we may update this Privacy Statement to clarify our practices or to reflect new or different privacy practices, such as when we add new features to our Sites.
